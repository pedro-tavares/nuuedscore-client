                My experience with NuuEDScore has been nothing put pure
                positivity and a refreshing reminder that there are programs
                that are clearly designed to engage and enhance the lives of
                young people. The Youth began the program with the words “I don't know” and ended the program with the ability to create
                and start their own business. "I don't know" was no longer a part
                of the vocabulary. I would recommend this experience to all
                young people in High School and college.

                When I think of the NuuEDScore entrepreneur class I think of one
                word "Energy". This was an in-depth course and Coach Jane and Coach
                Derrick had to adapt their whole curriculum to an online format.
                However this did not affect engagement, as their passion burst
                through the screen. Coach Derrick’s energy was infectious. He
                demanded for our youth to not only seize the day, but to be
                excited to be alive. Coach Jane was a constant anchor of
                knowledge and wisdom covering subjects from Resume building, to
                money management. It was obvious how much thought and work was
                put into adapting this curriculum to be engaging and relevant. I
                highly recommend NuuEDScore and was honored to be in the room
                learning new teaching techniques. Thank you NuuEDScore.

                As a youth development person for the past 30 years in San
                Francisco, I've seen a lot of programs that have come my way.
                NuuEDScore really walked the walk when it came to delivering a
                fun, engaging, educational and REAL entrepreneurship and job readiness program. I would give NuuEDScore my highest
                recommendation to anyone that is looking to get any teens from
                any walk of life into a program that makes young people believers in themselves at the end.

                My experience with NuuEDScore has been nothing put pure
                positivity and a refreshing reminder that there are programs
                that are clearly designed to engage and enhance the lives of
                young people. The Youth began the program with the words “I don't know” and ended the program with the ability to create
                and start their own business. "I don't know" was no longer a part
                of the vocabulary. I would recommend this experience to all
                young people in High School and college.

                When I think of the NuuEDScore entrepreneur class I think of one
                word "Energy". This was an in-depth course and Coach Jane and Coach
                Derrick had to adapt their whole curriculum to an online format.
                However this did not affect engagement, as their passion burst
                through the screen. Coach Derrick’s energy was infectious. He
                demanded for our youth to not only seize the day, but to be
                excited to be alive. Coach Jane was a constant anchor of
                knowledge and wisdom covering subjects from Resume building, to
                money management. It was obvious how much thought and work was
                put into adapting this curriculum to be engaging and relevant. I
                highly recommend NuuEDScore and was honored to be in the room
                learning new teaching techniques. Thank you NuuEDScore.

                As a youth development person for the past 30 years in San
                Francisco, I've seen a lot of programs that have come my way.
                NuuEDScore really walked the walk when it came to delivering a
                fun, engaging, educational and REAL entrepreneurship and job readiness program. I would give NuuEDScore my highest
                recommendation to anyone that is looking to get any teens from
                any walk of life into a program that makes young people believers in themselves at the end.
